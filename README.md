Python Basics :
1. Variables & Data Types:
A variable is used to store data in a program. Python automatically decides the type of data.
Main data types are:
int – stores whole numbers
float – stores decimal numbers
str – stores text
bool – stores True or False

2. Input and Output:
Input and output help the program interact with the user.
print() is used to display output.
input() is used to take data from the user.

3. Operators:
Operators are used to perform operations on values.
Arithmetic operators perform calculations.
Comparison operators compare values.
Logical operators combine conditions.

4. Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements are used to make decisions.
if checks a condition.
elif checks another condition.
else runs when no condition is true.

5. Loops:
Loops are used to repeat a block of code.
for loop is used when the number of repetitions is known.
while loop runs as long as the condition is true.

6. Functions:
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
Functions help in reusing code and organizing programs.

7. Lists:
A list stores multiple values in one variable.
Lists are ordered and can be changed.

8. Tuples:
A tuple is similar to a list but cannot be changed after creation.

10. Sets:
A set is an unordered collection of unique values.
It does not allow duplicate elements.

11. Dictionaries:
A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.
Each key is unique and used to access its value.
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
OOP is a programming concept where we organize code using classes and objects.
It helps in writing clean, reusable, and structured programs.

1. Class
A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It defines variables (data) and functions (methods).


2. Object
An object is a real instance of a class.
It represents real-world entities.

3. Constructor
A constructor is a special method that runs automatically when an object is created.
In Python, it is written as __init__().
It is used to initialize (assign) values to object variables.

4. Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding data and restricting direct access.
It protects data from being changed accidentally.

It is done using private variables in Python.

5. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to use the properties and methods of another class.
It helps in code reuse.

6. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means “many forms.”
It allows the same function name to perform different tasks.
